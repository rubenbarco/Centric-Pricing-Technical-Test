Centric Pricing Technical Test

Here we can find the GiHub repository for the Technical Test done during the week of 16th of October, 2023.
We can find 2 different files:
1. A Jupyter Notebook with the exercises 1 and 2
2. A Markdown file with the answers to the exercises 3 and 4


Here is some documentation that I have used:

* Dataset Information -> https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
* Library used to reshape the images -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-opencv-cv2-cvtcolor-method/
* Densenet Library-> https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/densenet/DenseNet201
